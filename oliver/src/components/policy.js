account, including through third-party services and client applications. You also have the option
of not sharing your score on the explore page to prevent other users from finding you.</p>

<p>When you log into your account with a device, we will associate that device with your account
for purposes such as authentication and personalization. Depending on your settings, we may
also personalize your experience on, and based on information from, devices besides the ones
you use to log into Oliver. For example, if you change your theme color for the first device, if
you log in with another device, the set theme would reflect on the new device as well, any
changes made from one device would also be add to your other devices as well. For example, if
you bookmark a question, on one device and log in with another, that question would
automatically be saved and transferred to the new device.</p>

regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to address
fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect our or our users’ rights or property. However,
nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may
have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.
